## BankMachineProject
A small app for handling bank errends

# Usage
The app works around letting the user check account balances and transfer money between accounts.
The user also have the possiblity to withdraw money from the account of their choosing.

# Build
I've choose to use a mixed structure of for-loops and arrays to handle user data. This because of the simpicity of using arrays as this project-
only have 5 permanent users. This works as far so long we don't want a dynamic banking program.


I have also choosen to create seperat methods for each function and tool to make it easier to understand and read the code.


# Improvments
Alot of things in the program can ofcourse be improved from whatever the user handling is built to how I take in user input.
One big problem is tha need to move the arrays and username though out the entire program on each method to be able to use calls to other methods.
This is from when starting the program and having a plan that slowly evolves and changes and after a bit there is to much to change and update to make the program work.
A better planing is always needed when It comes to development on your own.
Also some varible names should be more self-explainatory though some of these don't really make sense to someone else except myself.
Nested methods and condition statements is also a problem here and there in the program which could be made better with more planing and time.
This could be improved though either making more methods that are dynamic and can be reused multiple times instead of focusing on just the one part in the program.
If we would like to have a more dynamic program we would instead implement the usage of databases and classes to make user handling expandable and easier to understand.
